I am an MSCS student at [Stanford University](https://cs.stanford.edu/), specialized in Natural Language Processing. I graduated from [the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in December, 2022 with [Highest Honors](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/ugrad/honors-programs). As an undergraduate, I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) and worked closely with Prof. [Tarek Abdelzaher](https://abdelzaher.cs.illinois.edu/). My research aims to enable reliable, robust, and fair reasoning on NLP models. I am also passionate about other Augmented Language Models related fields such as knowledge patching, domain adaptation and controllable generation.

I was also fortunate to participate in two truly enriching research internships in the industry. From June 2021 to July 2022, I worked as a research intern at [the Data, Knowledge, and Intelligence group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/) at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/), supervised by Dr. [Mengyu Zhou](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mezho/). From June 2023 to September 2023, I worked as an applied scientist intern at APEX, [Amazon Alexa](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/business_categories/alexa-and-amazon-devices), supervised by Dr. [Mohamad Mehdi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdimohamad/).
