ðŸŒ² **\[Researchers\]** I'm actively seeking NLP research internships! Shoot me an [email](mailto:jx17@illinois.edu) if you need a new passionate NLP research intern. I already have my [Employment Authorization Document](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/optional-practical-training-opt-for-f-1-students) ready and can start today!

I am an MSCS student at [Stanford University](https://cs.stanford.edu/), specialized in Natural Language Processing. I graduated from [the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in December, 2022 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering (with [Highest Honors](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/ugrad/honors-programs)). As an undergraduate, I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) at [Blender NLP Lab](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/index.html). My research aims to improve NLP models' understanding of the deep semantics contained in textual and semi-structured data. I am also passionate about Augmented Language Models (ALM) related fields, such as Reasoning, Knowledge Patching, and Robust NLP.

From June 2021 to July 2022, I worked as a full-time NLP research intern at [the Data, Knowledge, and Intelligence group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/) at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/), supervised by Dr. [Mengyu Zhou](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mezho/). For more of my research and industry experiences, please refer to my [CV](https://liamjxu.github.io/assets/pdf/JialiangXu%20CV%202023.6.pdf).
