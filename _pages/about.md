Hi! I'm Jialiang. I am currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at [Stanford University](https://cs.stanford.edu/), where I have the privilege of working under the guidance of Prof. [Monica Lam](https://suif.stanford.edu/~lam/), focusing on LLM-related research. Before embarking on my graduate studies at Stanford, I had the opportunity to be mentored by Prof. [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) and work closely with Prof. [Tarek Abdelzaher](https://abdelzaher.cs.illinois.edu/), at [the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). From June 2021 to July 2022, I worked as a research intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/), supervised by Dr. [Mengyu Zhou](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mezho/). From June to September in 2023, I worked as an applied scientist intern at [Amazon Alexa](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/business_categories/alexa-and-amazon-devices), supervised by Dr. [Mohamad Mehdi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdimohamad/).

My research primarily aims to enable effective, robust, and interpretable Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning, understanding, and analysis on human language. In addition to LLMs, I am also passionate about building LLM-based real-world Autonomous Agents that are rigorous, tractable, and interactive.
