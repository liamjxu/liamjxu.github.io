I am a recent M.S. graduate in Computer Science from [Stanford University](https://cs.stanford.edu/), where I worked with [Prof. Percy Liang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/). 

My research centers on large language models (LLMs), particularly, identifying model weaknesses [[1]](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.542.pdf)[[2]](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.1147.pdf)[[3]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18740), improving model capabilities [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02691.pdf)[[2]](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.864.pdf), and building useful systems [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09818.pdf)[[2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00562)[[3]](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.938.pdf). I am also a strong proponent for democratizing model evaluation. I contributed to the maintenance and extension of [HELM](https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm), an open source Python framework for holistic, reproducible and transparent evaluation of foundation models. Most recently, I led the development of [HELM Capabilities](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2025/03/20/helm-capabilities.html), the latest flagship benchmark of the HELM suite.

Through assistantships and internships, I have had the privilege to collaborate with many exceptional researchers and engineers, including: [Yifan Mai](https://yifanmai.com), [Prof. Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/), and [Prof. Monica Lam](https://suif.stanford.edu/~lam/) at Stanford University; [Prof. Michael Moor](http://michaelmoor.me) now at ETH Zurich; [Prof. Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) and [Prof. Tarek Abdelzaher](https://abdelzaher.cs.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; [Prof. Denghui Zhang](https://www.stevens.edu/profile/dzhang42) and [Prof. Zhaozhuo Xu](https://ottovonxu.github.io) at Stevens Institute of Technology; [Dr. Mohamad Mehdi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdimohamad/), [Chetan Naik](https://chetannaik.github.io), and [Dr. Jane You](https://www.amazon.science/author/jane-you) at Amazon Alexa; and [Dr. Mengyu Zhou](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mezho/), [Shi Han](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/shihan/), and [Dr. Dongmei Zhang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/dongmeiz/) at Microsoft Research.
