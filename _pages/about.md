*I am actively seeking NLP research internship positions (able to work full-time until September 2023)! Shoot me an [email](mailto:jx17@illinois.edu) if you are interested.*

I graduated from [the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) with a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering (with [Highest Honors](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/ugrad/honors-programs)) in December, 2022. Prior to graduation, I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) at [Blender NLP Lab](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/index.html). My research aims to improve machines' understanding of **the deep semantics contained in textual and semi-structured data**. I am also interested in the NLP applications in various real-world scenarios, including **Semantic Analytics** and **Semantic Parsing**.

From June 2021 to July 2022, I worked as a full-time NLP research intern at [the Data, Knowledge, and Intelligence group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/) at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/), supervised by Dr. [Mengyu Zhou](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mezho/).
